KSH-93 is the most recent version of the KornShell Language
described in
"The KornShell Command and Programming Language,"
by Morris Bolsky and David Korn of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, ISBN 0-13-182700-6.
The KornShell is a shell programming language,
which is upward compatible with "sh" (the Bourne Shell),
and is intended to conform to the IEEE P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and
Utilities standard.
KSH-93 provides an enhanced programming environment in
addition to the major command-entry features of the BSD
shell "csh".  With KSH-93, medium-sized programming tasks can be
performed at shell-level without a significant loss in performance.
In addition, "sh" scripts can be run on KSH-93 without modification.
<P>
The code should conform to the IEEE POSIX 1003.1 standard and to the
proposed ANSI-C standard so that it should be portable to all
such systems.  Like the previous version, KSH-88,
it is designed to accept eight bit character sets
transparently, thereby making it internationally compatible.
It can support multi-byte characters sets with some characteristics
of the character set given at run time.
<P>
KSH-93 provides the following features, many of which were also inherent
in KSH-88:
<UL type=square>
<LI>
Enhanced Command Re-entry Capability:  The KSH-93 history
function records commands entered at any shell level and stores
them, up to a user-specified limit, even after you log off.
This allows you to re-enter long commands with a few keystrokes
- even those commands you entered yesterday.
The history file allows for eight bit characters in
commands and supports essentially unlimited size histories.
<LI>
In-line Editing: In "sh", the only way to fix mistyped
commands is to backspace or retype the line. KSH-93 allows you
to edit a command line using a choice of EMACS-TC or "vi"
functions.
You can use the in-line editors to complete filenames as
you type them.
You may also use this editing feature when entering
command lines from your history file.
A user can capture keystrokes and rebind keys to customize the
editing interface.
<LI>
Extended I/O Capabilities:  KSH-93 provides several I/O
capabilities not available in "sh", including the ability to:
<UL type=circle>
<LI>
specify a file descriptor for input and output
<LI>
start up and run co-processes
<LI>
produce a prompt at the terminal before a read
<LI>
easily format and interpret responses to a menu
<LI>
echo lines exactly as output without escape processing
<LI>
format output using printf formats.
<LI>
read and echo lines ending in "&#0092;".
</UL>
<LI>
Improved performance: KSH-93 executes many scripts faster
than the System V Bourne shell. A major reason for this is
that many of the standard utilities are built-in.
To reduce the time to initiate a command, KSH-93 allows
commands to be added as built-ins at run time
on systems that support dynamic loading such as System V Release 4.
<LI>
Arithmetic: KSH-93 allows you to do integer arithmetic in any
base from two to sixty-four.  You can also do double
precision floating point arithmetic.
Almost the complete set of C language operators are available
with the same syntax and precedence.
Arithmetic expressions can be used to as an argument expansion 
or as a separate command.
In addition there is an arithmetic for command that works
like the for statement in C.
<LI>
Arrays: KSH-93 supports both indexed and associative arrays.
The subscript for an indexed array is an arithmetic expression,
whereas, the subscript for an associative array is a string.
<LI>
Shell Functions and Aliases: Two mechanisms - functions and
aliases - can be used to assign a user-selected identifier to
an existing command or shell script.
Functions allow local variables and provide scoping
for exception handling.
Functions can be searched for and loaded on first reference the
way scripts are.
<LI>
Substring Capabilities:  KSH-93 allows you to create a
substring of any given string either by specifying the starting
offset and length, or by stripping off leading
or trailing substrings during parameter substitution.
You can also specify attributes, such as upper and lower case,
field width, and justification to shell variables.
<LI>
More pattern matching capabilities:  KSH-93 allows you to specify
extended regular expressions for file and string matches.
<LI>
KSH-93 uses a hierarchal name space for variables.
Compound variables can be defined and variables can
be passed by reference.  In addition, each variable
can have one or more disciplines associated with
it to intercept assignments and references.
<LI>
Improved debugging:  KSH-93 can generate line numbers on execution
traces.  Also, I/O redirections are now traced.
There is a DEBUG trap that gets evaluated after each command
so that errors can be localized.
<LI>
Job Control: On systems that support job control, including
System V Release 4, KSH-93
provides a job-control mechanism almost identical to that of
the BSD "csh", version 4.1.
This feature allows you
to stop and restart programs, and to move programs between the
foreground and the background.
<LI>
Added security:
KSH-93 can execute scripts which do not have read permission
and scripts which have the setuid and/or setgid set when
invoked by name, rather than as an argument to the shell.
It is possible to log or control the execution of setuid and/or
setgid scripts.
The noclobber option prevents you from accidentally erasing
a file by redirecting to an existing file.
<LI>
KSH-93 can be extended by adding built-in commands at run time.
In addition, KSH-93 can be used as a library that can
be embedded into an application to allow scripting.
</UL>
Documentation for KSH-93 consists of an "Introduction to KSH-93",
"Compatibility with the Bourne Shell" and a manual page and a
README file.  In addition, the "New KornShell Command and Programming
Language," book is available from Prentice Hall.

04-02-28  The ability to apply an append discipline to any variable has
	  been added.
04-02-14  A bug in which the exportall option (set -a) would cause incorrect
	  results for arrays has been fixed.
04-02-02  A bug in which an exported array would pass more than
	  the first element to a script invoked by name has been fixed.
04-02-02  A bug on some systems in which name=value pairs preceding a script
	  invoked by name was not getting passed to the script has been fixed.
04-01-20  A bug in which an unset discipline function could cause a core
	  dump on some systems has been fixed.
04-01-12  A bug in which a continue or break called outside a loop from
	  inside a function defined with name() syntax could affect 
	  the invoking function has been fixed.
04-01-08  If a command name begins with ~, only filename completion will be
	  attempted rather than pathname completion using the builtin editors. 
04-01-08  A bug in the vi edit mode in which the wrong repeat count on
	  multiple word replacements with the . directive has been fixed.
04-01-06  Backspace characters are now handled correctly in prompt strings.
04-01-06  The getopts builtin has been modified to accept numerical
	  arguments of size long long on systems that support this.
04-01-06  A bug in which unsetting all elements of an associative array
	  would cause it to be treated as an indexed array has been fixed.
03-12-15  A bug in which q quoted string ending with an unescaped $ would
	  delete the ending $ in certain cases has been fixed.
03-12-05  A bug in which the shell could hang when set -x tracing a command
	  when an invalid multibyte character is encountered has been fixed. 
03-12-05  On some systems, if the KEYBD trap is set, then commands that use
	  the meta key were not processed until return was hit.  This
	  has been fixed.
03-12-05  A problem which occured when the login shell was not a group
	  leader that could cause it to fail has been fixed.
03-12-05  A problem in which a shell could core dump after receiving a signal
	  that should cause it to terminate while it was in the process
	  of acquiring more space has been fixed.
03-12-05  If ENV is not specified, the shell will default to $HOME/.kshrc
	  for interactive shells.
03-11-21  A bug introduced in ksh93o in which the DEBUG trap could get
	  disabled after it triggered has been fixed. 
03-11-04  A bug in which using arithetic prefix opertors ++ or -- on a
	  non-lvalue could cause a core dump has been fixed.
03-11-04  A bug in which leading zeros were stripped from variable
	  expansions within arithmetic compution to avoid being treated
	  as octal constants when they should not have, has been fixed.
03-10-08  A bug introduced in ksh93o in which a large here document inside
	  a function definition could get corrupted has been fixed.
03-09-22  A bug in which the .get discipline function was not being
	  called when a string variable was implictly referenced from
	  within a numerical expression has been fixed.
03-09-22  A bug in which a script without a leading #! could get executed
	  by /bin/sh rather than the current shell on some systems has
	  been fixed.
03-09-12  To improve conformance with ksh88, leading zeros will be ignored
	  when getting the numerical value of a string variable so that
	  they will not be treated as octal constants.
03-09-03  The builtin kill command now processes obsolete invocations
	  such as kill -1 -pid.
03-09-02  The restriction on modifying FPATH in a restricted shell (sh -r)
	  has been documented.
03-09-02  The restricted shell (sh -r) has been modified to disallow
	  executing command -p.
03-08-07  A bug in which the KEYBD trap was not being invoked when
	  characters with the 8th bit set has been fixed.
03-08-02  A parser bug introduced in ksh93o which caused the character
	  after () in a Posix function definition to be skipped 
	  when reading from standard input has been fixed.
03-08-01  A bug in which "${foo#pattern}(x)" treated (x) as if it were
	  part of the pattern has been fixed.
03-08-01  The command -x option has been modified so that any trailing
	  arguments that do expand to a single word will be included
	  on each invocation, so that commands like command -x mv * dir
	  work as expected.

03-07-20  --- Release ksh93o+  ---
03-07-20  A bug in which could cause memory corruption when a posix
	  function invoked another one has been fixed.
03-07-15  A bug in which a file descriptor&gt;2 could be closed before
	  executing a script has been fixed.
03-07-15  A parsing error for &lt;() and &gt;() process subsitituions inside
	  command substitution has been fixed.
03-07-15  A parsing error for patterns of the form {...}(...) when
	  used inside ${...} has been fixed.
03-07-15  An error in which expanding an indexed array inside a compound
	  variable could cause a core dump has been fixed.
03-07-15  A bug in which under on rare ocassions a job completion interrupt
	  could cause to core dump has been fixed.
03-06-26  A bug in which process substitution embeded within command
	  substitution would generate a syntax error has been fixed.
03-96-23  A bug in which ${@:offset:len} could core dump when there
	  were no arguments has been fixed.
03-96-23  A bug in which ${X&#0091;@&#0093;:offset:len} could core dump when X
	  was unset has been fixed.
03-06-22  The -x option was added to the command builtin.  If this
	  option is on, and the number of arguments would exceed ARG_MAX,
	  the command will be invoked multiple times with a subset of
	  the arguments.  For example, with alias grep='command -x grep,
	  any number of arguments can be specified.
03-06-14  A bug in which could cause a core dump on some systems with
	  vi and emacs editors with the MULTIBYTE option has been fixed.
03-06-06  A bug in which the shell could core dump when a script was
	  run from its directory, and the script name a symlink to a file
	  beginning with .., has been fixed.
03-06-05  A bug in which the shell could core dump when a child process
	  that it is unaware of terminates while it is calling malloc()
	  has been fixed.
03-06-02  An option named globstar (set -G) has been added.  When enabled,
	  during pathname expansion, any component that consists only of ** is
	  matches all files and any number of directory levels.
03-05-30  A bug in which the PATH search could give incorrect results when
	  run from directory foo and PATH contained .:foo:xxx has been fixed.
03-05-29  Some changes were made to the code that displays the prompt in edit 
	  mode to better handle escape sequences in the prompt.
03-05-27  I added = to the list of characters that mark the beginning of
	  a word for edit completion so that filenames in assignments
	  can be completed.
03-05-20  A bug in which read -N could hang on some systems when reading
	  from a terminal or a pipe has been fixed.
03-05-19  A bug in which the ouput of uname from a command substitution
	  would go to the standard output of the invoking command when
	  uname was invoked with a non-standard option has been fixed.
03-05-19  A job control bug which would cause the shell to exit because 
	  it hadn't take back the terminal has been fixed.  The bug
	  could occur when running a function that contained a pipeline
	  whose last element was a function.
03-05-19  A job control timing bug introduced in ksh93o on some systems
	  which could cause a pipeline to hang if the first component
	  completed quickly has been fixed.
03-05-13  The read builtin has been modified so that the builtin editors
	  will not overwrite output from a previous incomplete line. 
03-05-13  A bug in which the name of an identifier could have the string
	  .sh. prefixed to it after expanding a variable whose name begins
	  with .sh. has been fixed.
03-05-13  A bug in the expansion of $var for compound variables in which
	  some elements would not be output when the name was a prefix
	  of another name in the compound variable has been fixed.
03-05-08  The last item in the ksh93o release on 03-01-02 has been
	  altered sligthly to preserve the leading 0's when the
	  preceding character is a digit.  Thus, with typeset -LZ3 x=10,
	  $(( 1$x)) will be 1010 whereas $(( $x) will be 10.
03-04-25  A bug in which if x is a name reference, then nameref y=x.foo
	  did not follow x has been fixed.

03-03-18  --- Release ksh93o  ---
03-03-18  A -N unary operator was added to test and &#0091;&#0091;...&#0093;&#0093; which returns
	  true if the file exists and the file has been modified since it
	  was last read.
03-03-18  The TIMEFORMAT variable was added to control the format for
	  the time compound command.  The formatting description is
	  described in the man page.
03-03-06  A -N n option was added to read which causes exactly n bytes
	  to be read unlike -n n which causes at most n bytes to be read.
03-03-03  Three new shell variables were added.  The variable .sh.file
	  stores the full pathname of the file that the current command
	  was found in.  The variable .sh.fun names the current function
	  that is running.  The variable .sh.subshell contains the depth
	  of the current subshell or command substitution.
03-03-03  When the DEBUG trap is executed, the current command line after
	  expansions is placed in the variable .sh.command.  The trap
	  is also now triggered before each iteration of a for, select,
	  and case command and before each assignment and redirection.
03-02-28  Function definitions are no longer stored in the history file so
	  that set -o nolog no longer has any meaning.
03-02-28  All function definitions can be displayed with typeset -f not
	  just those stored in the history file.  In addition, typeset +f
	  displays the function name followed by a comment containg the
	  line number and the path name for the file that defined this function.
03-02-28  A bug in which the value of $LINENO was not correct when executing
	  command contained inside mult-line command substitutions has been
	  fixed.
03-02-19  Since some existing ksh88 scripts use the undocumented and
	  unintended ability to insert a : in front of the % and # parameter
	  expansion operators, ksh93 was modified to accept :% as equivalent
	  to % and :# as equivalent to # with ${name op word}.
03-02-14  A bug which could cause a core dump when reading from standard
	  error when standard error was a pty has been fixed.
03-02-14  The shell arithmetic was modified to use long double on systems
	  that provide this data type.
03-02-09  A bug in which a function located in the first directory in FPATH
	  would not be found when the last component of PATH was . and the
	  current directory was one of the directories in PATH has been fixed.
03-02-07  The trap and kill builtin commands now accept a leading SIG prefix
	  on the signal names as documented.
03-02-05  A bug in the expansion of ${var/$pattern}, when pattern contained
	  \&#0091; has been fixed.
03-02-05  A bug in which .sh.match&#0091;n&#0093;, n&gt;0, was not being set for substring
	  matches with % and %% has been fixed.
03-01-15  A bug in which getopts did not work for numerical arguments specified
	  as n#var in the getopts string has been fixed.
03-01-09  A bug in which using ${.sh.match} multiple times could lead to
	  a memory exception has been fixed.
03-01-06  A bug in the expansion of ${var/pattern/$string} in the case that
	  $string contains \digit has been fixed. 
03-01-02  A -P option was added for systems such as Solaris 8 that support
	  profile shell.
03-01-02  For backward compatibility with ksh88, arithmetic expansion
	  with ((...)) and let has been modified so that if x is a zero-filled
	  variable, $x will not be treated as an octal constant.

02-12-05  --- Release ksh93n+  ---
02-11-30  A bug that can show up in evaluating arithmetic statements that
	  are in an autoloaded function when the function is autoload from
	  another function has been fixed.
02-11-30  An optimization bug in which an expansion of the form ${!name.@},
	  which occurred inside a for or a while loop, when name is a name
	  reference, has been fixed.
02-11-18  A bug in which modifying array variables in a subshell could leave
	  side effects in the parent shell environment has been fixed.
02-11-18  A memory leak when unsetting an associative array has been fixed.
02-11-14  The code to display compound objects was rewritten to make
	  it easier for runtime extensions to reuse this code.
02-11-14  A change was made to allow runtime builtins to be notified when
	  a signal is received so that cleanup can be performed.
02-10-31  User applications can now trap the ALRM signal.  Previously,
	  the ALRM signal was used internally and could not be used
	  by applications. 
02-10-31  A bug in which signals received while reading from a coprocess
	  for which traps were set was not handled correctly has been fixed.
02-10-31  A bug in which a file opened with exec inside a subshell could
	  be closed before the subshell completed has been fixed.
02-10-21  A bug in which setting PATH or FPATH inside a function might not
	  take effect has been fixed.
02-10-21  A bug which could cause a core dump when a local SECONDS variable
	  is defined in a function has been fixed.
02-10-15  A bug in which the associate array name operator ${!array&#0091;@&#0093;}
	  could return the same name multiple times has been fixed.
02-10-15  A bug in which the zero'th element of an associative array was
	  not getting set when an assignment was made without a subscript
	  specified has been fixed.

02-09-30  --- Release ksh93n  ---
02-09-30  The maximum indexed array size was increased to 16Megs.
02-09-30  A bug which could cause a core dump when changing attributes
	  of associative array has been fixed.
02-09-30  A bug in which exporting an array variable would not export the
	  0-th element has been fixed.
02-09-30  A bug in which an array assignment of the form a=($a ...) would unset
	  'a' before the right hand side was evaluated has been fixed.
02-09-27  A bug in which the error message for ${var?message} when var was
	  null or unset did not contain the variable name var has been fixed.
02-09-27  A bug in which closing file descriptors 0 through 2 could
	  cause a subsequent here document to fail has been fixed. 
02-09-14  A bug in whence which occurs when the specified name contained
	  a / has been fixed.
02-09-14  A bug in the parser for strings of the form name$((expr))=value
	  has been fixed.
02-09-14  A for loop optimization bug in which the number of elements in
	  an array was treated as an invariant has been fixed.
02-09-09  A bug in which redirection or closing of a file descriptor between
	  3 and 9 could cause a subsequent here document to fail has been
	  fixed. 
02-09-09  A bug in which a background job was not removed from the job list
	  when a subshell completed has been fixed, for example (prog&amp;). 
02-09-03  A bug in which an assignment of the form name=(integer x=3)
	  could be interpretted as an array assignment rather than a
	  compound variable assignment has been fixed.
02-08-19  A command completion bug which occurred on file systems that
	  are case insensitive has been fixed.
02-08-19  A bug which could lead to an exception on some systems (for
	  example FREEBSD) which occurred when setting PATH has been fixed.
02-08-11  A bug in arithmetic rounding in which a value input as a decimal
	  string would output as a rounded version of the string has
	  been fixed.
02-08-11  A bug in which the last character could be deleted from shell
	  traces and from whence when called from a multibyte locale
	  has been fixed.
02-08-01  A bug which could cause a core dump to occur when a shell script
	  is executed while a coprocess is running that has closed the
	  output pipe has been fixed.
02-08-01  A bug in which command completion in multibyte mode could
	  corrupt memory for long command lines has been fixed.

02-06-17  --- Release ksh93n-  ---
02-06-17  A bug in which user defined macros could cause a core dump in
	  with MULTIBYE mode has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which printf format specifiers of the form %2$s were causing
	  a core dump has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which setting stty to noecho mode did not prevent the
	  echoing of characters by ksh when emacs or viraw mode
	  was enabled has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which background job completion could cause the sleep
	  builtin to terminate prematurely has been fixed.
02-06-17  A bug in which the shell could core dump if getopts was called
	  when the OPTIND variable contained a negative value has been fixed. 
02-06-10  The edit mode prompt has been modified to handle escape sequences.  
02-06-10  A bug which occurred for interactive shells in which the builtin
	  cat command was used in command substitution on a file whose
	  size was larger than PIPE_BUF has been fixed.
02-06-10  A bug in which the trap on ERR was not being processed when
	  set inside a function has been fixed.
02-06-07  A bug in which function definitions could cause the history count
	  to be decremented by one (and even become negative) has been fixed.
02-06-05  A bug in read in which share mode could be enabled has been fixed.
02-05-28  A bug which could occur when the last command of a script was
	  a case statement and the action selected ended in ;&amp; instead of ;;
	  has been fixed.
02-05-23  A bug with unary + introduced in ksh93k has been fixed.
02-05-07  A bug in substitutions of the form ${var/pattern/string} in which
	  a backslash was inserted in the replacement string when it contained
	  a special pattern character has been fixed.
02-05-01  A bug in the emacs edit mode which occurred in versions compiled
	  for multibyte character sets which occurred when a repeated search
	  was requested after a long line had been returned for the previous
	  search has been fixed.
02-04-02  vi and emacs edit modes were modified so that tab completion is
	  disabled when invoked from the read built-in.

02-03-26  --- Release ksh93m+  ---
02-03-26  A bug in which &nbsp;was not handled correctly when used in file
	  expansion has been fixed.
02-02-18  A bug in which lines beginning with a # were deleted from here
	  documents when the here-document delimiter was followed by
	  a comment has been fixed.
02-12-06  An optimization bug in which ${!x&#0091;@&#0093;) was treated as invariant in
	  a for loop has been fixed.
02-02-06  A bug in which the ERR trap is not cleared for a script invoked
	  by name from within a function has been fixed.
02-01-08  A bug in which a shell script executed from within a subshell
	  could cause this script to have an invalid pointer leading
	  to a memory fault has been fixed. 
02-01-07  Added here documents of the form &lt;&lt;&lt; word (as per zsh) which
	  is equivalent to &lt;&lt; delimordelim.
02-01-07  A bug in which the first word of a compound assignment,
	  x=(word ...), was treated as a reserved word has been fixed.
02-01-07  A bug in the handling of &nbsp;when noglob was enabled and a
	  substitution of the form ${word op pattern} occurred in the
	  same word has been fixed.
02-01-07  A compilation option, CMDLIB_BLTIN in the file OPTION, has
	  been added.  When this options is set, all commands implemented
	  in libcmd become shell builtin commands by default.
02-01-07  A bug in which builtin foo, where foo is already a builtin
	  would result in the builtin foo getting removed has been fixed. 
02-01-07  A bug which the shell executed a command found in the current
	  directory when PATH have no valid directories has been fixed.
01-11-28  The value of $? was not being set when called with exit.
01-11-28  If the last command was of the form (...) and a trap on EXIT or
	  ERR was set, and the command inside () modified the trap, then
	  the original trap wasn't executed.
01-11-26  The value for 0 is now preceded by the base number when
	  the base was not 10.
01-11-26  The default has compilation mode has been changes so that
	  viraw mode will always be on.

01-10-31  --- Release ksh93m  ---
01-10-31  A for loop optimizer bug for subshells contained withing for
	  loops has been fixed.
01-10-16  typeset without arguments no longer outputs variable names
	  that do not have any attributes that are set.
01-10-16  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which assignments specified with
	  the exec built-in were not being expanded properly has been
	  fixed.
01-10-11  An optimization bug in which ${!x) was treated as invariant in
	  a for loop has been fixed.
01-10-11  Unsigned integer variables in bases other than 10 are printed now
	  expand in that base with the base prefix.
01-10-10  A number of typos in the self generating man pages for shell
	  built-ins have been fixed.
01-10-04  The self generated man pages for hist and fc were not working
	  correctly and have been fixed.
01-10-03  Yet another optimizer bug in which shell patterns were
	  treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-09-27  Two bugs relating to multibyte history searches and to find
	  have been fixed.
01-09-27  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which the PATH searching was
	  not restored after running a command with an assignment list 
	  has been fixed.
01-09-26  A bug in which a zero filled field was treated as octal when
	  converted to integer has been fixed.
01-09-26  Yet another bug in the optimization of for loops related to
	  recursive functions with break or continue statements has been fixed.
01-09-25  The exponentiation operator ** was added to the shell arithmetic
	  evaluation.  It has higher precedence than * and is left
	  associative.
01-09-25  The code was modified to use the ast multibyte macros
	  and functions for handing multibyte locales.
01-09-25  The expansion ${parameter:offset:length} now handles negative
	  offsets which cause offsets to be measured from the end.
01-09-25  Some spelling errors in the documentation were corrected.
01-09-24  The /dev/tcp/host/port and /dev/udp/host/port now allow
	  the ports to be specified by service name. 
01-09-24  The change staring with ksh93g in which the the appropriate
	  library path variable is prepended with a corresponding library
	  directory has been modified.  With the new method, only the
	  library path defined in the file named .paths in the directory
	  where the executable is found will be modified.  See the
	  man page for more details.
01-09-23  The .fpath file (see ksh93h) is no longer looked for in each
	  directory on the path to locate function directories.  The
	  file named .paths is used instead.
01-09-23  A bug in which IFS was not being restored after being changed in
	  a subshell has been fixed.
01-09-16  With the vi and emacs edit modes, after a list of command
	  or functions is generated with = or M-= respectively,
	  any element from the list can be pasted on the command line
	  by preceding the = or M-= with a numeric parameter specifying
	  the position on the list.
01-09-16  A bug in ksh93l caused command completion not to find aliases
	  and functions.  Command listing from the edit mode was presented
	  in reverse order.  This has been fixed.
01-09-13  Another bug in the optimization of for loops related to subshells
	  when traps were set has been fixed.
01-09-07  A change in ksh93l caused brace expansion to stop working
	  and this has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which an arithmetic statement
	  within a function that used name references did not follow the
	  reference has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which export -p did not prefix
	  each export with the word export has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug in multibyte input which occurred when a partial multibyte
	  character was received has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug introduced in ksh93l which could cause a core dump
	  when an assignment list containing PATH is specified inside
	  command substitution has been fixed.
01-08-09  Another bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  errors in recursive functions using local variables that
	  contained for loops has been fixed.
01-07-27  A bug in which IFS would be unset after a command substitution
	  inside a here document has been fixed.
01-07-26  To conform to the POSIX standard, if you invoked ksh name,
	  and name does not contain a /,  it will first try to run
	  one in the current directory whether it is executable or not
	  before doing a path search for an executable script.  Earlier
	  versions first checked for an executable script using the
	  PATH variable.
01-07-23  A bug in which unset -f invoked in a subshell could unset a
	  function defined in the parent has been fixed.
01-07-16  A bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  name references to be treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-07-09  A bug in which a discipline function applied to a local variable
	  could cause a shell exception has been fixed.  Discipline
	  functions can only be specified for global variables. 

01-06-18  --- Release ksh93l  ---
01-06-18  A bug in assigning integers larger than can be represented as
	  long integers to floating point variables has been fixed.
01-06-18  A bug in the handling of unsigned integers (typeset -ui) has
	  been fixed.
01-06-04  The evaluation of the PS1 prompt no longer effects the value
	  of the $? variable.
01-06-01  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-22  A bug in which attributes for variables that did not have
	  values would be lost after a subshell has been fixed.
01-05-22  The %R format has been added to convert a shell pattern into
	  an extended regular expression.
01-05-22  The escape sequences &#0092;, <JOIN>X, \C&#0091;.collating-element.&#0093;, and
	  \x{hex} have been added to ASCII-C strings and to printf format
	  strings.
01-05-20  Patterns of the form {n}(pattern) and {m,n}(pattern) are now
	  recognized.  The first form matches exactly n of pattern whereas,
	  the second form matches from m to n instances of pattern.
01-05-20  The shell allows *-(pattern), +-(pattern),  ?-(pattern),
	  {m,n}-(pattern}, and @-(pattern) to cause the minimal
	  match of pattern to be selected whenever possible rather
	  than the maximal (greedy) match. 
01-05-20  The character class &#0091;:word:&#0093; has been added to patterns.
	  The word class is the union of &#0091;:alnum:&#0093; and the character _.
01-05-20  Inside (...) pattern groups, the &nbsp;character is now treated
	  specially even when in an enclosing character class.  The
	  sequences, \w, \d, \s are equivalent to the character classes
	  word, digit, and space respectively.  The sequences \W, \D,
	  and \S are their complement sets. 
01-05-20  The shell now recognizes pattern groups of the form
	  ~(options:pattern) where options or :pattern can be omitted.
	  Options use the letters + and - to enable and disable options
	  respectively.  The option letters g (greedy), i (ignore case)
	  are used to cause maximal matching and to cause case
	  insensitive matching respectively.  If :pattern is also
	  specified, these options are only in effect while this
	  pattern is being processed.  Otherwise, these options remain
	  in effect until the end of the pattern group that they are contained
	  in or until another ~(...) is encountered.  These pattern groups
	  are not counted with respect to group numbering.
01-05-14  When edit completion, expansion, or listing occurs in the
	  middle of a quoted string, the leading quote is ignored when
	  performing the completion, expansion, or listing.
01-05-14  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-10  A bug in which open files were not restored after a subshell
	  that had used exec to replace a file has been fixed. 
01-05-10  Redirection to a null file name now generates an error message. 
01-05-09  The shell now rejects some invalid parameter substitutions that
	  were previously processed in undefined ways.
01-05-09  A bug in which the output of select was not flushed before the
	  read when input did not come from the terminal has been fixed. 
01-05-08  A bug in which job ids would not be freed for interactive shells
	  when subshells ran built-ins in the background has been fixed.
01-05-08  The FPATH variable now requires an explicit . to cause the
	  current directory to be treated as a function directory. 
01-05-08  A bug in read -n when echo mode was disabled has been fixed.
01-05-07  A bug in which function definitions could be listed as part
	  of the history has been fixed.
01-04-30  This release uses a new and often much faster pattern matcher than
	  earlier releases.
01-04-30  An optimizer now eliminates invariant parameter expansions from
	  for while and until loops.
01-04-30  The variable .sh.match is set after each pattern match (# % or /)
	  in a variable substitution.  The variable .sh.match is an
	  indexed array with element 0 being the complete match. 
	  The array is only valid until the next subsequent pattern
	  match or until the value of the variable changes which ever
	  comes first.
01-04-30  A self generating man page has been added to shcomp.  Also,
	  shcomp now stops compiling when it finds an exit or exec
	  command and copies the remainder so that it can be used
	  for standard input.
01-04-30  The shcomp command was modified so that it can work in an
	  EBCIDIC environment and that binary scripts are portable
	  across environments.
01-04-30  A bug in the handling of a trailing : in PATH has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which the builtin version of a command would get invoked
	  even though the full pathname for the command was specified
	  has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which read would loose the last character when
	  reading the last line of a file that did not contain a new-line
	  character has been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which in vi mode the end of file
	  character and end of line character could be swapped has
	  been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which invoking a shell script that
	  did not have execute permission could set the exit value to
	  127 rather than 126 has been fixed.
01-04-20  A bug in which read -n from a pipe would block if fewer than
	  n characters was received has been fixed.
01-04-09  A bug in which invalid patterns, for example, ) by itself,
	  was not treated as a string has been fixed so that if i=')',
	  then &#0091;&#0091; $i == $i &#0093;&#0093; is true.
01-04-09  The shell arithmetic now interprets C character constants.
01-04-09  A bug in which a non-zero return from a function defined
	  with the function reserved word did not trigger the ERR
	  trap or exit with set -e has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, in which characters above 127 were
	  not displayed correctly in vi or emacs edit mode has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, introduced in the 'k' point release, in
	  which the erase character in viraw mode was moving the cursor
	  to the left without erasing the character has been fixed.
01-04-02  On some systems the wcwith() function was returning a wrong
	  value for characters and caused characters to be displayed
	  incorrectly from the shell edit modes.  A work around for
	  this problem has been added. 
01-03-26  A bug in which valid scripts could produce syntax errors
	  when run with locales that considered characters such as "'"
	  to be space characters has been fixed.
01-03-20  A bug in which an syntax error in an arithmetic expression
	  entered interactively could cause the shell to go into
	  an infinite loop outputting the error message has been fixed.
01-03-10  ksh93 accepts -l as a synonym for -L in test on systems for
	  which /bin/test -l tests for symbolic links.
01-03-10  A bug in parsing scripts in which { and } are used in place of
	  in and esac in case statements embedded in compound commands
	  has been fixed.  Use of { and } for in and esac is obsolete.
01-03-06  A bug in which an argument of the form foo=bar was not
	  being passed correctly to a traced function whose name
	  was foo has been fixed.
01-03-02  Using $(trap -p name) did not print the name of the current
	  trap setting for trap name.
01-02-26  Exported floating point variables gave incorrect results
	  when passing them to ksh88.  This has been fixed.
01-02-25  A race condition in which a coprocess which completed too quickly
	  would not allow subsequent coprocesses to start has been fixed.
01-02-25  The 'g' format specifier is now handled by printf.  It had
	  inadvertently been omitted.
01-02-20  The + was not being displayed during an execution trace
	  with the += assignment operator.
01-02-19  The error message which occurs when the interpreter name
	  defined on the #! line does not exist is more informative.
01-02-19  A bug in which $0 would not be set correctly when a
	  script with #! was invoked by full pathname from the
	  directory of the script has been fixed.
01-02-19  A shell script did not always pick up tty mode changes
	  made by external commands such as stty which could
	  effect the behavior of read.
01-02-19  The -u, -g, and -k unary tests did not give the correct
	  results when used with negation and this has been fixed.

01-02-05  --- Release ksh93k+  ---
01-02-05  The sequence \&lt;newline&gt; inside $'...' was not incrementing
	  the line count and this has been fixed.
01-02-05  Modified expansion of "${@-}" so that if no arguments are set
	  it results in null string rather than nothing.
01-02-02  memory leak problem with local variables in functions fixed.
01-01-25  allow arithmetic expressions with float%int and treat them
	  as ((int)float)%int rather than as an error. 
01-01-19  read -n1 was not working and has been fixed.
01-01-17  ksh now handles the case in which a here document in command
	  substitution $() is terminated by the trailing ).  Previously,
	  a new-line was needed at the end of the delimiter word. 
01-01-02  A bug in which a KEYBD trap would cause a multi-line token
	  to be processed incorrectly has been fixed.
00-12-10  Arithmetic integer constants can now have L and U suffices.

	  bug only occurs when ksh93 is compiled without MULTIBYTE enabled.
00-11-29  A bug in which jobs -p would yield 0 for background
	  jobs run in a script has been fixed.
00-11-21  A bug in integer arrays in which the number of elements is
	  incorrect when the ++ operator is applied to a non-existing
	  element has been fixed.  For example, integer x; ((x&#0091;3&#0093;++)).
00-11-20  A timing bug in which the shell could reset the terminal
	  group to the wrong value in the case that the a new process
	  changes the terminal group during startup has been fixed.

00-10-27  --- Release ksh93k  ---
00-10-27  Using tab for completion now works only when applied
	  after a non-blank character at the end of the current line.
	  In other case a tab is inserted.
00-10-27  A bug in the emacs edit mode for ^X^E has been fixed.
	  The ^X^E sequence is supposed to invoke the full editor
	  on the current command.
00-10-18  A bug in which expansions of the form ${var//pattern/string}
	  did not work correctly when pattern was '/' or "/" has
	  been fixed.
00-10-18  The output format for indexed arrays in compound variables
	  has been modified so that it can be used as input.
00-10-18  Assignments with name references (typeset -n) will now
	  implicitly unreference an existing name reference.
00-10-17  A bug the += append operator when a single array element
	  is appended to a variable that is not an array has been fixed.
00-10-16  A bug in which the SIGCONT signal was being sent to
	  each process will kill -0 or kill -n 0 has been fixed.

	  has been fixed.
00-08-08  Removed build dependency on iswprint() and iswalph().
00-07-20  In some cases the read builtin would read more than a single
	  line from a pipe on standard input and therefore leave the seek
	  position in the wrong location.
00-07-05  If the directory / is on the path, a / will not be inserted
	  between the directory and the file name during path searching
	  to avoid searching // for systems that treat this specially.

00-05-09  Modified command substitution to avoid using /tmp files when
          run on read-only file systems. 
00-04-17  Modified printf to handle '%..Xc' and '%..Xs' options where X
	  is not an alpha character.  Previous versions core dumped with this.
00-04-10  Changes to multibyte editing code were made to use standard
	  ISO C functions rather than methods devised before the standard.
00-04-09  Add %H options to printf to output strings with &lt;"'&amp;\t&gt; properly
	  converted for use in HTML and XML documents.

	  correctly on some systems as described in the 'g' point
	  release has been fixed. 
00-03-07  printf now returns a non-zero exit status when one of
          its arguments cannot be converted to the given type. 
00-03-05  The return value and error message for a command that
          was found on the path but was not executable was set
          incorrectly.
00-03-05  A prototype for ioctl() was removed from the vi edit mode.

00-01-28  --- Release ksh93i  ---
00-01-28  Most of the built-in commands and ksh itself are now
          self documenting.  Running command --man will produce
          screen output.  Running command --html produces the
          man page in html format.
00-01-28  The getopts builtin can process command description
          strings to produce man pages.
00-01-28  A bug in which a script could terminate when getopts
          encountered an error when invoked inside a function
          has been fixed.
00-01-28  When a symbolic link was specified as the name of
          the script to invoke by name, the value of $0 was
          set to the real file name rather than the link name
          in some cases and this has been fixed.
00-01-28  A bug in which the precision given as an argument
	  to printf was not working has been fixed.

99-03-31  --- Release ksh93h  ---
99-03-31  The PATH search algorithm has been modified to look
	  for a file named .fpath in each bin directory and if
	  found, to search for functions in this directory if
	  it cannot find the command in that directory.
99-03-31  When performing pathname expansion, the shell checks
	  to see whether each directory it reads is case sensitive
	  or not, and performs the matching accordingly.
99-03-31  The %T format for printing formatted date/time.
99-03-31  The emacs and vi modes now handle arrow keys when
          they use standard ANSI escape sequences.

	  has been fixed.
99-03-31  A bug in which the value of $? was changed when executing

99-03-31  The handling of SIGCHLD has been changed so that the
	  trap is not triggered while executing trap commands
	  to avoid recursive trap calls.
99-03-31  A bug in which a local variable in a function declared readonly
	  would generated an error when the function went out of
