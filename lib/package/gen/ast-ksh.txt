The AT&T Labs Research ast-ksh package contains ksh and support
libraries. This is the minimal set of components needed to build ksh.

Source Package Installation Instructions:

  (1) Do not install packages as root/super-user. Although some components may
      have setuid executables, few must be owned by root. These are best
      changed manually when the security implications are understood.
  (2) Choose a package root directory and cd to it. This will be a local work
      area for all packages. See (9) for installing packages for public use.
  (3) Create the subdirectory lib/package/tgz and download all package archives
      into that directory. The package(1) command maintains the contents of this
      directory and deletes old archives as new ones are read in. Package
      delta archives require the most recent base, so manually removing files
      in this directory may invalidate future deltas.
  (4) If the bin/package command does not exist then manually read the INIT
      source package:
		gunzip < lib/package/tgz/INIT.YYYY-MM-DD.tgz | tar xvf -
      If your system does not have tar(1) or gunzip(1) then download the ratz
      source package, compile it, and manually read the INIT
      source package:
		mkdir bin
		cp lib/package/tgz/ratz.YYYY-MM-DD.c lib/package/tgz/ratz.c
		cc -o bin/ratz lib/package/tgz/ratz.c
		bin/ratz -lm < lib/package/tgz/INIT.YYYY-MM-DD.tgz
  (5) Read all unread package archive(s):
		bin/package read
      Both source and binary packages will be read by this step.
  (6) Build and install; all generated files are placed under arch/$HOSTTYPE
      ($INSTALLROOT), where $HOSTTYPE is defined by the output of
      bin/package (with no arguments.) name=value arguments are supported; CC
      and CCFLAGS are likely candidates. The output is written to the terminal
      and captured in $INSTALLROOT/lib/package/gen/make.out:
		bin/package make
  (7) List make results and interesting errors from (6):
		bin/package results
      Run the regression tests:
		bin/package test
      List test results and errors:
		bin/package results test
  (8) Run the binaries by
		export PATH=$INSTALLROOT/bin:$PATH
		ksh
      or by adding $INSTALLROOT/lib to the runtime linker search list
      (the variable that is assigned the value ../lib in the
      $INSTALLROOT/bin/.paths file.) If you want to build individual
      components run:
		bin/package use
      to get an interactive $SHELL that sets up the environment for using
      package binaries:
	  $HOSTTYPE	 the current host type
	  $PACKAGEROOT	 the root directory for all packages ($P)
	  $INSTALLROOT	 the installation root for the current host type ($A)
	  $PATH		 $INSTALLROOT/bin:$PACKAGEROOT/bin prepended
	  $VPATH	 a multi-level view; all building done in $INSTALLROOT
          DLL-MAGIC	 environment magic for locating package shared libraries
      From this shell you can run nmake in any directory under
      $INSTALLROOT/src and rebuild just that part. If $INSTALLROOT/bin/nmake
      does not exist then use $INSTALLROOT/bin/mamake on Mamfile.
      nmake is open source - download ast-open or ast-base to
      simplify future builds or to make new or delta packages.
  (9) Once you are satisfied with a package its binaries can be installed in
      a public area by:
		bin/package install DIRECTORY PACKAGE
      or you can just copy the entire $INSTALLROOT directory tree. Users can
      run the binaries by
		export PATH=DIRECTORY/bin:$PATH
		ksh
      or by adding DIRECTORY/lib to the runtime linker search list.

	  for multibyte character sets which occurred when a repeated search
	  was requested after a long line had been returned for the previous
	  search has been fixed.

02-01-07  A compilation option, CMDLIB_BLTIN in the file OPTION, has
	  been added.  When this options is set, all commands implemented
	  in libcmd become shell builtin commands by default.
02-01-07  A bug in which builtin foo, where foo is already a builtin
	  would result in the builtin foo getting removed has been fixed. 
02-01-07  A bug which the shell executed a command found in the current
	  directory when PATH have no valid directories has been fixed.
01-11-28  The value of $? was not being set when called with exit.
01-11-28  If the last command was of the form (...) and a trap on EXIT or

01-11-26  The value for 0 is now precdeded by the base number when
	  the base was not 10.

	  viraw mode will always be on.

01-10-31  --- Release ksh93m  ---
01-10-31  A for loop optimizer bug for subshells contained withing for
	  loops has been fixed.
01-10-16  typeset without arguments no longer outputs variable names
	  that do not have any attributes that are set.
01-10-16  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which assignments specified with
	  the exec built-in were not being expanded properly has been
	  fixed.
01-10-11  An optimization bug in which ${!x) was treated as invariant in
	  a for loop has been fixed.
01-10-11  Unsigned integer variables in bases other than 10 are printed now
	  exxpand in that base with the base prefix.
01-10-10  A number of typos in the self generating man pages for shell
	  built-ins have been fixed.
01-10-04  The self generated man pages for hist and fc were not working
	  correctly and have been fixed.
01-10-03  Yet another optimizer bug in which shell patterns were
	  treated as invariants has been fixed.
01-09-27  Two bugs relating to multibyte history searches and to find
	  have been fixed.
01-09-27  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which the PATH searching was
	  not restored after running a command with an assignment list 
	  has been fixed.
01-09-26  A bug in which a zero filled field was treated as octal when
	  converted to integer has been fixed.
01-09-26  Yet another bug in the optimization of for loops related to
	  recursive functions with break or continue statements has been fixed.
01-09-25  The exponentiation operator ** was added to the shell arithmetic
	  evaluation.  It has higher precedence than * and is left
	  associative.
01-09-25  The code was modified to use the ast multibyte macros
	  and functions for handing multibyte locales.
01-09-25  The expansion ${parameter:offset:length} now hanles negative
	  offsets which cause offsets to be measured from the end.
01-09-25  Some spelling errors in the documentation were corrected.
01-09-24  The /dev/tcp/host/port and /dev/udp/host/port now allow
	  the ports to be specified by service name. 
01-09-24  The change staring with ksh93g in which the the appropriate
	  library path variable is prepended with a corresponding library
	  directory has been modified.  With the new method, only the
	  library path defined in the file named .paths in the directory
	  where the executable is found will be modified.  See the
	  man page for more details.
01-09-23  The .fpath file (see ksh93h) is no longer looked for in each
	  directory on the path to locate function directories.  The
	  file named .paths is used instead.
01-09-23  A bug in which IFS was not being restored after being changed in
	  a subshell has been fixed.
01-09-16  With the vi and emacs edit modes, after a list of command
	  or functions is generated with = or M-= respectively,
	  any element from the list can be pasted on the command line
	  by preceding the = or M-= with a numeric parameter specifying
	  the position on the list.
01-09-16  A bug in ksh93l caused command completion not to find aliases
	  and functions.  Command listing from the edit mode was presented
	  in reverse order.  This has been fixed.
01-09-13  Another bug in the optimization of for loops related to subshells
	  when traps were set has been fixed.
01-09-07  A change in ksh93l caused brace expansion to stop working
	  and this has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93k in which an arithmetic statement
	  within a function that used name references did not follow the
	  reference has been fixed.
01-09-04  A bug introduced in ksh93l in which export -p did not prefix
	  each export with the word export has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug in multibyte input which occurered when a partial multibyte
	  character was received has been fixed.
01-08-29  A bug introduced in ksh93l which could cause a core dump
	  when an assignment list containing PATH is specified inside
	  command substitution has been fixed.
01-08-09  Another bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  errors in recursive functions using local variables that
	  contained for loops has been fixed.
01-07-27  A bug in which IFS would be unset after a command substituion
	  inside a here document has been fixed.
01-07-26  To conform to the POSIX standard, if you invoked ksh name,
	  and name does not contain a /,  it will first try to run
	  one in the current directory whether it is executable or not
	  before doing a path search for an executable script.  Earlier
	  versions first checked for an executable script using the
	  PATH variable.
01-07-23  A bug in which unset -f invoked in a subshell could unset a
	  function defined in the parent has been fixed.
01-07-16  A bug in the optimization of for loops in ksh93l caused
	  name references to be treated as invariantes has been fixed.
01-07-09  A bug in which a discipline function applied to a local variable
	  could cause a shell exception has been fixed.  Discipline
	  functions can only be specified for global variables. 

01-06-18  --- Release ksh93l  ---
01-06-18  A bug in assigning integers larger than can be represented as
	  long integers to floating point variables has been fixed.
01-06-18  A bug in the handling of unsigned integers (typeset -ui) has
	  been fixed.
01-06-04  The evaluation of the PS1 prompt no longer effects the value
	  of the $? variable.
01-06-01  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-22  A bug in which attributes for variables that did not have
	  values would be lost after a subshell has been fixed.
01-05-22  The %R format has been added to convert a shell pattern into
	  an extended regular expression.
01-05-22  The escape sequences \e, \cX, \C[.collating-element.], and
	  \x{hex} have been added to ASCII-C strings and to printf format
	  strings.
01-05-20  Patterns of the form {n}(pattern) and {m,n}(pattern) are now
	  recognized.  The first form matches exactly n of pattern whereas,
	  the second form matches from m to n instances of pattern.
01-05-20  The shell allows *-(pattern), +-(pattern),  ?-(pattern),
	  {m,n}-(pattern}, and @-(pattern) to cause the minimal
	  match of pattern to be selected whenever possible rather
	  than the maximal (greedy) match. 
01-05-20  The character class [:word:] has been added to patterns.
	  The word class is the union of [:alnum:] and the character _.
01-05-20  Inside (...) pattern groups, the \ character is now treated
	  specially even when in an enclosing character class.  The
	  sequences, \w, \d, \s are equivalent to the character classes
	  word, digit, and space respectively.  The sequences \W, \D,
	  and \S are their complement sets. 
01-05-20  The shell now recognizes pattern groups of the form
	  ~(options:pattern) where options or :pattern can be omitted.
	  Options use the letters + and - to enable and disable options
	  respectively.  The option letters g (greedy), i (ignore case)
	  are used to cause maximal matching and to cause case
	  insensitive matching respectively.  If :pattern is also
	  specified, these options are only in effect while this
	  pattern is being processed.  Otherwise, these options remain
	  in effect until the end of the pattern group that they are contained
	  in or until another ~(...) is encountered.  These pattern groups
	  are not counted with respect to group numbering.
01-05-14  When edit completion, expansion, or listing occurs in the
	  middle of a quoted string, the leading quote is ignored when
	  performing the completion, expansion, or listing.
01-05-14  A small memory leak from subshells has been fixed.
01-05-10  A bug in which open files were not restored after a subshell
	  that had used exec to replace a file has been fixed. 
01-05-10  Redirection to a null file name now generates an error message. 
01-05-09  The shell now rejects some invalid parameter substitutions that
	  were previously processed in undefined ways.
01-05-09  A bug in which the output of select was not flushed before the
	  read when input did not come from the terminal has been fixed. 
01-05-08  A bug in which job ids would not be freed for interactive shells
	  when subshells ran built-ins in the background has been fixed.
01-05-08  The FPATH variable now requires an explicit . to cause the
	  current directory to be treated as a function directory. 
01-05-08  A bug in read -n when echo mode was disabled has been fixed.
01-05-07  A bug in which function definitions could be listed as part
	  of the history has been fixed.
01-04-30  This release uses a new and often much faster pattern matcher than
	  earlier releases.
01-04-30  An optimizer now eliminates invariant parameter expansions from
	  for while and until loops.
01-04-30  The variable .sh.match is set after each pattern match (# % or /)
	  in a variable substitution.  The variable .sh.match is an
	  indexed array with element 0 being the complete match. 
	  The array is only valid until the next subsequent pattern
	  match or until the value of the variable changes which ever
	  comes first.
01-04-30  A self generating man page has been added to shcomp.  Also,
	  shcomp now stops compiling when it finds an exit or exec
	  command and copies the remainder so that it can be used
	  for standard input.
01-04-30  The shcomp command was modified so that it can work in an
	  EBCIDIC environment and that binary scripts are portable
	  across environments.
01-04-30  A bug in the handling of a trailing : in PATH has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which the builtin version of a command would get invoked
	  even though the full pathname for the command was specified
	  has been fixed.
01-04-30  A bug in which read would loose the last character when
	  reading the last line of a file that did not contain a new-line
	  character has been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which in vi mode the end of file
	  character and end of line character could be swapped has
	  been fixed.
01-04-23  A bug on some systems in which invoking a shell script that
	  did not have execute permission could set the exit value to
	  127 rather than 126 has been fixed.
01-04-20  A bug in which read -n from a pipe would block if fewer than
	  n characters was received has been fixed.
01-04-09  A bug in which invalid patterns, for example, ) by itself,
	  was not treated as a string has been fixed so that if i=')',
	  then [[ $i == $i ]] is true.
01-04-09  The shell arithmetic now interprets C character constants.
01-04-09  A bug in which a non-zero return from a function defined
	  with the function reserved word did not trigger the ERR
	  trap or exit with set -e has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, in which characters above 127 were
	  not displayed correctly in vi or emacs edit mode has been fixed.
01-04-02  A bug on some systems, introduced in the 'k' point release, in
	  which the erase character in viraw mode was moving the cursor
	  to the left without erasing the character has been fixed.
01-04-02  On some systems the wcwith() function was returning a wrong
	  value for characters and caused characters to be displayed
	  incorrectly from the shell edit modes.  A work around for
	  this problem has been added. 
01-03-26  A bug in which valid scripts could produce syntax errors
	  when run with locales that considered characters such as "'"
	  to be space characters has been fixed.
01-03-20  A bug in which an syntax error in an arithmetic expression
	  entered interactively could cause the shell to go into
	  an infinite loop outputting the error message has been fixed.
01-03-10  ksh93 accepts -l as a synonym for -L in test on systems for
	  which /bin/test -l tests for symbolic links.
01-03-10  A bug in parsing scripts in which { and } are used in place of
	  in and esac in case statements embedded in compound commands
	  has been fixed.  Use of { and } for in and esac is obsolete.
01-03-06  A bug in which an argument of the form foo=bar was not
	  being passed correctly to a traced function whose name
	  was foo has been fixed.
01-03-02  Using $(trap -p name) did not print the name of the current
	  trap setting for trap name.
01-02-26  Exported floating point variables gave incorrect results
	  when passing them to ksh88.  This has been fixed.
01-02-25  A race condition in which a coprocess which completed too quickly
	  would not allow subsequent coprocesses to start has been fixed.
01-02-25  The 'g' format specifier is now handled by printf.  It had
	  inadvertently been omitted.
01-02-20  The + was not being displayed during an execution trace
	  with the += assignment operator.
01-02-19  The error message which occurs when the interpreter name
	  defined on the #! line does not exist is more informative.
01-02-19  A bug in which $0 would not be set correctly when a
	  script with #! was invoked by full pathname from the
	  directory of the script has been fixed.
01-02-19  A shell script did not always pick up tty mode changes
	  made by external commands such as stty which could
	  effect the behavior of read.
01-02-19  The -u, -g, and -k unary tests did not give the correct
	  results when used with negation and this has been fixed.

01-02-05  --- Release ksh93k+  ---
01-02-05  The sequence \<newline> inside $'...' was not incrementing
	  the line count and this has been fixed.
01-02-05  Modified expansion of "${@-}" so that if no arguments are set
	  it results in null string rather than nothing.
01-02-02  memory leak problem with local variables in functions fixed.
01-01-25  allow arithmetic expressions with float%int and treat them
	  as ((int)float)%int rather than as an error. 
01-01-19  read -n1 was not working and has been fixed.
01-01-17  ksh now handles the case in which a here document in command
	  substitution $() is terminated by the trailing ).  Previously,
	  a new-line was needed at the end of the delimiter word. 
01-01-02  A bug in which a KEYBD trap would cause a multi-line token
	  to be processed incorrectly has been fixed.
00-12-10  Arithmetic integer constants can now have L and U suffices. 
00-12-10  A bug in the processing of arithmetic expressions with compound
	  variables when the -n option is on has been fixed.
00-12-08  A bug in M-f and M-b from emacs mode has been fixed.  This
	  bug only occurs when ksh93 is compiled without MULTIBYTE enabled.
00-11-29  A bug in which jobs -p would yield 0 for background
	  jobs run in a script has been fixed.
00-11-21  A bug in integer arrays in which the number of elements is
	  incorrect when the ++ operator is applied to a non-existing
	  element has been fixed.  For example, integer x; ((x[3]++)).
00-11-20  A timing bug in which the shell could reset the terminal
	  group to the wrong value in the case that the a new process
	  changes the terminal group during startup has been fixed.

00-10-27  --- Release ksh93k  ---
00-10-27  Using tab for completion now works only when applied
	  after a non-blank character at the end of the current line.
	  In other case a tab is inserted.
00-10-27  A bug in the emacs edit mode for ^X^E has been fixed.
	  The ^X^E sequence is supposed to invoke the full editor
	  on the current command.
00-10-18  A bug in which expansions of the form ${var//pattern/string}
	  did not work correctly when pattern was '/' or "/" has
	  been fixed.
00-10-18  The output format for indexed arrays in compound variables
	  has been modified so that it can be used as input.
00-10-18  Assignments with name references (typeset -n) will now
	  implicitly unreference an existing name reference.
00-10-17  A bug the += append operator when a single array element
	  is appended to a variable that is not an array has been fixed.
00-10-16  A bug in which the SIGCONT signal was being sent to
	  each process will kill -0 or kill -n 0 has been fixed.
00-10-12  The arithmetic evaluation portion has been rewritten to
	  perform a number of optimizations.
00-10-10  A bug in which name prefix matching ${!name.*} was not
	  checking name to see if it was a name reference has been fixed.
00-09-26  A bug in the multibyte version in which the width of for
	  non-printing characters was not correct has been fixed.
00-09-12  Made changes to get multibyte editing work on UWIN for windows
00-09-12  A bug in which multibyte characters would be displayed incorrectly
	  has been fixed.
00-08-08  Removed build dependency on iswprint() and iswalph().
00-07-20  In some cases the read builtin would read more than a single
	  line from a pipe on standard input and therefore leave the seek
	  position in the wrong location.
00-07-05  If the directory / is on the path, a / will not be inserted
	  between the directory and the file name during path searching
	  to avoid searching // for systems that treat this specially.
00-06-26  A bug in which on rare occasions wait could return before all
	  jobs have completed has been fixed.
00-06-21  A bug in which backspace did not work correctly during the
	  R replace directive in vi-mode has been fixed.
00-06-12  Added variable name completion/expansion/listing  to the set of
	  completions.  Variable name completions begin with $ or "$ followed
	  by a letter. 
00-05-09  --- Release ksh93j  ---
